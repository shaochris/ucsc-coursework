Lab2: Introduction to logic with multimedia logic

In this lab assignment, I learned how to implement a truth table into a circuit and make it visualized with MML. In addition, it help me to understand the relationships among AND gate, OR gate, XOR gate and their inverse version, which makes course CE16's learning more sense to me. When I was doing part D, I draw a truth table as and try to implement it with MML. Then, I was confusing I could I implement such a truth table that has so many situations. As a result, I realized that I don't need to implement the truth table exactly. It just helped me to think it through. Then I used XOR inverse gate to complete part D and it seems much easier and clear than I thought in the first place. According to this assignment, I believe that it helps me to connect with practices and theories.

How would you make your own 7-segment display from Part B if you didnâ€™t have one in MML?
Answer: I'd like to build my 7-segment display with 8 LED lights and make them become 8 rows to represent numbers. I'll make the first switch connects to all the lights. And the second switch connects to first 4 lights, which is from row1 to row 4. Then the third switch connects to the following 2 lights, which is from row5 to6. Last, I will connect the forth switch to the last light, which is row8.This would be my method.

How do you think the random number generator works?
Answer: I think the random number generator is generating pseudorandom numbers, because the mechanical nature of computers is like giving command to ask computers to do several things. And the Operator System is the collection of command lines with Graphic User interactions. Therefore, the random number generator is basically recall the numbers on a table and compute with some functions which contains sufficient data.

How can things be really random in a computer when it is made of logic gates, which are
supposed to be deterministic?
Answer: I believe that things could never be really random in a computer when it is made of logic gates, since the mechanical nature of computers is following by rules so that every computer could have the same output and operation by same inputs and command.
